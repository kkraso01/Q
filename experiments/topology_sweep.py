# Hardware-Aware Topology Sweep for QDS
# TODO: Simulate linear, heavy-hex (IBM), and all-to-all qubit architectures.
# - Plot alpha (false positive rate) vs circuit depth vs connectivity.
# - Use Qiskit transpiler to estimate realistic hardware costs.
# - Generate transpiler logs for appendix.
# - Compare routing overhead and error rates across topologies.
