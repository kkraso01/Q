# General Lower Bounds for Quantum Data Structures

## TODO: Prove m ≥ Ω(log(1/α) / (1-ε)) for QDS in the quantum cell probe model.
- Use Holevo bound, no-cloning, error propagation.
- Add batch advantage theorem (variance reduction cap).
- Document proof techniques: Fano's inequality, Holevo, data-processing.
